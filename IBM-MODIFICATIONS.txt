- Description: When the device locale is set to a LTR language, any RTL
string should be left-justified. This fix involved adding supportsLTR
attribute to AndroidManifest.xml as well as adding some changes into
cordova-plugin-dialogs to use the device's locale. These changes to the 
plugin are in commit: c88acd6. The plugin changes don't need to be backported
because they made it into a plugin refresh that went into WL6.3
