- Full description: Using plugins sometimes causes the application to crash because of 
a ConcurrentModificationException. Plugins execute on non-ui thread by default, and if 
a plugin calls "getPlugin()" while the ui thread is dispatching an onMessage (or one of 
the various other plugin functions), then the "for (CordovaPlugin p : pluginMap.values())"
fires an exception due to getPlugin() modifying the map. This is a race condition and 
is solved by adding a null entry for each non-startup plugin to avoid the
ConcurrentModificationException.
