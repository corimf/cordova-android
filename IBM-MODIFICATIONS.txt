Cordova-android. These were filed as CVE-2014-3500 (Cross-application scripting
via Android intent URLs), CVE-2014-3501 (Cordova whitelist bypass for non-http URLs)
and CVE-2014-3502 (Cordova apps can potentially leak data to other apps via android intent URLs.)

intent extras, editing the whitelist logic, and creating a new "internal" whitelist for
intent URLs that should be allowed (geo:, sms:, etc.)
