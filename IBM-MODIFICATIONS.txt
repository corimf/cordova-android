RTC: 31827 - PMR 81991,211,788 : video capture on 4.3 Nexus

Video Capture fails with Android 4.3 on Nexus devices

- RTC work item number: 31827
- Apache Cordova Jira issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-5202
- Markmail or Google Group reference: none
- Product PMR: PMR 81991,211,788
- Description: Capturing video with a Nexus device running Android 4.3 was failing
because Android was not returning the correct file location for the newly recorded video.
The fix involved grabbing the newly created video's file location if it did not exist
in the intent. The bug seems to be isolated to Nexus devices on Android 4.3


RTC: 31534 - Backport CB-5398 (image picker) to 2.6 ESR

Workaround image picker issue with content:// URIs

- Markmail or Google Group reference: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19834842/android-gallery-on-kitkat-returns-different-uri-for-intent-action-get-content
- Product PMR: APAR: http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI07246
- Description: Backport CB-5398 to this branch. Without it, starting in Android
4.4.x, selecting an image with the Camera plugin API would only work when
the image was chosen from "Downloads" folder, or when the user chose an image by
going through the Gallery app, or when the image was returned as a DATA_URL.
This issue is caused by a content:// URI encoding problem with Android. The workaround
chosen forces the image picker to always go through the Gallery app instead of the 
StorageAccessFramework, which was introduced in 4.4. 


webview methods need to be run on UI thread starting in Android 4.3

- RTC work item number: 31732
- Apache Cordova Jira issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-4858
- Markmail or Google Group reference: none
- Product PMR: none
- Description: backport CB-4858 to this branch. Without it, starting in Android
  4.3 the InAppBrowser may fail to open, and calls to window.open for the 
  InAppBrowser would throw a Java exception. Also fixed the project.properties
  file to remove the reference to Google APIs and just use Android APIs.
