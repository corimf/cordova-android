Security Vulnerability Patch for Exploiting Intents

- Cordova RTC work item number: 75631
- Apache Cordova Jira issue: 
- Markmail / Google Group / StackOverflow reference:
- IBM PMR: 9X999,999,000
- Worklight RTC work item number: (APAR) 75615
- CVE-2015-1835: Remote exploit of secondary configuration variables in Apache Cordova on Android
- Full description: Unwanted users are able to use intents to start an application 
and modify the config.xml with preferences that the developer did not specify. The 
intent injects the preference tag with a name and value into the config.xml so the 
unwanted user is able to start and exploit the application remotely. The vulnerability 
is limited to injecting the preference tag, but it is still exploiting the application 
nonetheless. The fix for this is to remove the intent functionality. No one will be 
able to use intents to start their app or inject preferences.
