- Description: Severe remote exploitation vulnerabilities were discovered in 
Cordova-android. These were filed as CVE-2014-3500 (Cross-application scripting
via Android intent URLs), CVE-2014-3501 (Cordova whitelist bypass for non-http URLs)
and CVE-2014-3502 (Cordova apps can potentially leak data to other apps via android intent URLs.)
The fixes included getting errorURL and startURL only from the Config class and never from
intent extras, editing the whitelist logic, and creating a new "internal" whitelist for
intent URLs that should be allowed (geo:, sms:, etc.)

- Description: Revert the workaround for image picker problem with content:// URI's.
Remove the workaround from cordova-plugin-camera, and cherry-pick commits into 
cordova-android that apply the content URI fix to all URIs, which means the 
StorageAccessFramework will work correctly with the camera plugin. This was 
previously done for Cordova 3.1esr.
