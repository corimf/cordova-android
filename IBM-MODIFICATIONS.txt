Apply security fixes for cordova-android vulnerabilities

- RTC work item number: 45720
- Apache Cordova Jira issue: 
- Markmail or Google Group reference:
- Product PMR:
- Description: Severe remote exploitation vulnerabilities were discovered in 
Cordova-android. These were filed as CVE-2014-3500 (Cross-application scripting
via Android intent URLs), CVE-2014-3501 (Cordova whitelist bypass for non-http URLs)
and CVE-2014-3502 (Cordova apps can potentially leak data to other apps via android intent URLs.)
The fixes included getting errorURL and startURL only from the Config class and never from
intent extras, editing the whitelist logic, and creating a new "internal" whitelist for
intent URLs that should be allowed (geo:, sms:, etc.). For Cordova 2.6.0esr, we had to 
manually insert changes from b0b628ff into IceCreamCordovaWebViewClient becuase it was
not a clean merge due to previous backports. Also had to make some manual adjustments to
make sure everything compiled, like adding back in the org.apache.cordova.api namespace
to certain files. 


RTC: 38095 - Investigate/backport CB-4096: whitelist rewrite to 2.9x and below

- RTC work item number: 38095
- Apache Cordova Jira issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-4096
- Markmail or Google Group reference: private mailing list, thread "Fwd: Security Vulnerabilities in Apache Cordova / PhoneGap"
- Product PMR: none
- Description: This commit is to pre-emptively backport Whitelist support to 2.6.0esr.
A security issue was filed against Cordova: http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2014/Jan/96 
The community response was to claim that most of the identified issues were not a problem
if users follow best practices: https://wiki.apache.org/cordova/BugtraqResonseDraft
However, there is valid bug in the Whitelist starting at 2.9.x and below: if foo.com
is whitelisted, foo.com.evil.com will also pass the whitelist test. This was fixed in 3.1
by rewriting the whitelist implementation. This commit backports that fix, another required
for a clean cherry-pick, and reverts to using cordova.api.log instead of cordova.log for 2.6.0


RTC: 31827 - PMR 81991,211,788 : video capture on 4.3 Nexus

Video Capture fails with Android 4.3 on Nexus devices

- RTC work item number: 31827
- Apache Cordova Jira issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-5202
- Markmail or Google Group reference: none
- Product PMR: PMR 81991,211,788
- Description: Capturing video with a Nexus device running Android 4.3 was failing
because Android was not returning the correct file location for the newly recorded video.
The fix involved grabbing the newly created video's file location if it did not exist
in the intent. The bug seems to be isolated to Nexus devices on Android 4.3


RTC: 31534 - Backport CB-5398 (image picker) to 2.6 ESR

Workaround image picker issue with content:// URIs

- RTC work item number: 31534
- Apache Cordova Jira issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-5398
- Markmail or Google Group reference: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19834842/android-gallery-on-kitkat-returns-different-uri-for-intent-action-get-content
- Product PMR: APAR: http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PI07246
- Description: Backport CB-5398 to this branch. Without it, starting in Android
4.4.x, selecting an image with the Camera plugin API would only work when
the image was chosen from "Downloads" folder, or when the user chose an image by
going through the Gallery app, or when the image was returned as a DATA_URL.
This issue is caused by a content:// URI encoding problem with Android. The workaround
chosen forces the image picker to always go through the Gallery app instead of the 
StorageAccessFramework, which was introduced in 4.4. 


webview methods need to be run on UI thread starting in Android 4.3

- RTC work item number: 31732
- Apache Cordova Jira issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-4858
- Markmail or Google Group reference: none
- Product PMR: none
- Description: backport CB-4858 to this branch. Without it, starting in Android
  4.3 the InAppBrowser may fail to open, and calls to window.open for the 
  InAppBrowser would throw a Java exception. Also fixed the project.properties
  file to remove the reference to Google APIs and just use Android APIs.
