Move requestFocusFromTouch() to be called during createViews()

- Cherry-pick: 
- Full description: Due to moving createViews() to be called before plugin 
initialization, the function requestFocusFromTouch() was being called later, and 
this caused some complication with the focusing of the app if you add a dialog. The 
button on the dialog would appear as if it is being pressed, thus having focus on 
startup without user input. Moving that function to be called ealier returned it to 
the expected behavior.

- Full description:  Cordova uses a bridge that allows the Native Application to 
communicate with the HTML and Javascript that control the user interface. To protect 
this bridge on Android, the framework uses a BridgeSecret to protect it from 
third-party hijacking. However, the BridgeSecret is not sufficiently random and can 
be determined in certain scenarios. Using a secure randomization function will 
ensure that the BridgeSecret is better randomized and secure. 

Update cordova.js snapshot

- IBM PMR: 93552,999,760
- Worklight RTC work item number: (APAR) 84893
- Cherry-pick: 
- Full description: On older Android versions, cordova appliations would hang on the 
splashscreen and this error would show in logcat "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set 
property connection of #<Navigator> which has only a getter" Some older versions of Android 
do not support Navigator so a check was needed before setting the property. There 
are other updates to this file unrelated to this issue. 

Security Vulnerability Patch for Exploiting Intents

- Markmail / Google Group / StackOverflow reference:
- IBM PMR: 9X999,999,000

- CVE-2015-1835: Remote exploit of secondary configuration variables in Apache Cordova on Android
- Full description: Unwanted users are able to use intents to start an application 
and modify the config.xml with preferences that the developer did not specify. The 
intent injects the preference tag with a name and value into the config.xml so the 
unwanted user is able to start and exploit the application remotely. The vulnerability 
is limited to injecting the preference tag, but it is still exploiting the application 
nonetheless. The fix for this is to remove the intent functionality. No one will be 
able to use intents to start their app or inject preferences. 

Fix app crash due to ConcurrentModificationException

- Full description: Using plugins sometimes causes the application to crash because of 
a ConcurrentModificationException. Plugins execute on non-ui thread by default, and if 
a plugin calls "getPlugin()" while the ui thread is dispatching an onMessage (or one of 
the various other plugin functions), then the "for (CordovaPlugin p : pluginMap.values())"
fires an exception due to getPlugin() modifying the map. This is a race condition and 
is solved by adding a null entry for each non-startup plugin to avoid the
ConcurrentModificationException. 
Also need to create the webview before initializing plugins.
