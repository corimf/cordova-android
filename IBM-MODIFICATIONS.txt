- Description: Revert the workaround for image picker problem with content:// URI's.
Remove the workaround from cordova-plugin-camera, and cherry-pick commits into 
cordova-android that apply the content URI fix to all URIs, which means the 
StorageAccessFramework will work correctly with the camera plugin. This was 
previously done for Cordova 3.1esr.
