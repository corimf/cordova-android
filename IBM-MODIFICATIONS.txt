- Product PMR/APAR: found internally before release
- Description: During the 3.6.0 development timeframe, a modification was made to CordovaActivity.onCreate() to move the activation of preferences to CordovaActivity.init(). For applications that were relying on the activation of preferences in onCreate(), those preferences are no longer active when onCreate() completes, and may break those applications. Although it is described as a "subtle change to the API surface" in the commit message, this is a breaking change to a public API.

- Description: When the device locale is set to a LTR language, any RTL
string should be left-justified. This fix involved adding supportsLTR
attribute to AndroidManifest.xml as well as adding some changes into
cordova-plugin-dialogs to use the device's locale. These changes to the 
plugin are in commit: c88acd6. The plugin changes don't need to be backported
because they made it into a plugin refresh that went into WL6.3
