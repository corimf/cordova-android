- Description: The previous patch fixed the problem on API 19 Android 4.4.2 KitKat, although the problem
persist over Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean and below.
This the patch taken from 6e222c3938db43fc00f3d6f8fbb138af075c689b(https://github.com/apache/cordova-android/commit/6e222c3938db43fc00f3d6f8fbb138af075c689b)
fixes the problem by all means, and for all versions. The previous patch doesn't have to be removed.
This fix, generates an internal whitelist entry when access="*", instead of whitelist=null.
Creates internal whitelist entries for: http://*/ and https://*/.
So the unlimited access it becomes into unlimited access for http & https protocol only. 
Using that approach we can avoid a null object in whiteList and "about:blank" can't be loaded on loadURL method.

- Cherry-pick: 890e12c30674d7b4dff54082e9ee879505475e19
- Description: When hitting the back button while alert dialog is being rendered causes a leaked window,
when resuming the app by clicking on its icon using the home screen or using the Multitask button, 
the webview doesn't render completely, it shows a blackscreen. 

This is get fixed by keeping track of the last AlertDialog showed.
The last dialog showed that is rendered while hitting back button it causes a leaked window, 
so during onDestroy event, the webview will only destroy the last one showed, avoiding 
the exception and fixing the problem.

- Description: After switching device language on android, the android application was crashing.
The main reason of this behavior is the config.xml origin="*" tag, this specifies access to 
all kind of resources on the network and makes the whiteList object on the WhiteList class a null object, 
indicating that when origin="*", there's no whiteList, all is allowed. There's a condition, right before
loadUrl(), that it checks the whitelist, and if null, this condition passes and triggers a load of about:blank.
Applying those cherry picks, those kind of load("about:blank") will be stopped, if the view is currently
loading a URL,ignoring multiple onPageFinished() callbacks & onReceivedError using stopLoading().

Apply security fixes for cordova-android vulnerabilities

- RTC work item number: 45720
- Apache Cordova Jira issue: 
- Markmail or Google Group reference:
- Product PMR:
- Description: Severe remote exploitation vulnerabilities were discovered in 
Cordova-android. These were filed as CVE-2014-3500 (Cross-application scripting
via Android intent URLs), CVE-2014-3501 (Cordova whitelist bypass for non-http URLs)
and CVE-2014-3502 (Cordova apps can potentially leak data to other apps via android intent URLs.)
The fixes included getting errorURL and startURL only from the Config class and never from
intent extras, editing the whitelist logic, and creating a new "internal" whitelist for
intent URLs that should be allowed (geo:, sms:, etc.)

Backport content:// URI fix to 3.4 so StorageAccessFramework will work

- Description: Revert the workaround for image picker problem with content:// URI's.
Remove the workaround from cordova-plugin-camera, and cherry-pick commits into 
cordova-android that apply the content URI fix to all URIs, which means the 
StorageAccessFramework will work correctly with the camera plugin. This was 
previously done for Cordova 3.1esr.
